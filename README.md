## 🧠 About This Course

This repository contains my study notes, implementations, and experiments developed while taking the **Computer Science** course.

The main goal of this class is to strengthen:

- **Algorithmic thinking**
- **Problem-solving skills**
- **Understanding of computational complexity**
- **Implementation of fundamental algorithms**

All content is implemented and documented using **Jupyter Notebooks** to combine theory, code, and examples in a clear learning workflow.
